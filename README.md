# stoic-bot
For this week's project, I decided to build a philosopher bot on [Discord](https://discord.com/). I'll walk you through the most important parts of the build and explain what I've learned during the process.   ## Why build a bot?  Honestly, I just wanted to have fun. I might end up building conversational bots down the line and I thought this might be a good start.  ## Requirements  1. A web browser. 2. A Google account.  That's it. We're living in an incredible time where tools such as [repl.it](https://repl.it/~) exist. If it's your first time hearing about repl.it, it's an online IDE that includes over 60 different programming languages such as Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and C++.
